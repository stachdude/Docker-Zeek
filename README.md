# Docker-Zeek
Builds docker zeek IDS with pf-ring and jemalloc from master

# Build


    docker build . -t zamani/zeek

# Run


```
docker run --net=host -itd -name zeekctl -v /home/zamani/zeek/etc:/usr/local/zeek/etc -v /home/zamani/zeek/live/:/usr/local/zeek/spool/logger-1 -v /home/zamani/zeek/logs/:/usr/local/zeek/logs/  zamani/zeek
```

We have 3 folder on host mashin:
- etc : 
In this folder config files of zeekctl are exist (node.cfg, network.cfg, zeekctl.cfg).
- live : current log save on this folder
- logs : archive logs save on this folder

If you want to see theoutput of different stages of zeekcontrol (deploy, install and start), you can use the `-it` parameter instead of `-itd`. In this case, you can see the following output:
